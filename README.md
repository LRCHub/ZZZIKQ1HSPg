```
Birds are chirping, sun's coming up
As I'm going down, down, down
Verse 1
Don't worry babe, it's all on me
When I disappear under the sheets,
you start to feel tingly
Don't worry baby
Just lay back, bite your bottom lip
and get as much as you need
I know you gotta go to work
so let me work it out right quick
and send you happy
Chorus
Let me say Good Morning
Let me get that breakfast in bed baby
before you leave
I wanna say Good Morning
Just wanna make sure you start
your day properly
Said I'm tryna have it
Ever running, ever running,
ever running ever running
through your mind babe
All damn day, said I'm tryna have it
Ever running, ever running,
ever running ever running
through your mind babe
Said I'm tryna have it
Verse 2
The shower, I'll follow you,
and now I got you begging,
cause your boss be stressing
You really need to get dressed and go
But then I kiss your neck,
and you melt in my arms
You bout to be late no doubt
I need to hear you scream and shout
I need you to melt in my mouth
I need you for two to three more hours
I need you to let me say Good Morning
Chorus
Good Morning,
Let me get that breakfast in bed baby
before you leave
I wanna say Good Morning
Just wanna make sure you start
your day properly
Ever running, ever running,
ever running ever running
through your mind babe
Running through your mind baby
Ever running, ever running,
ever running ever running
through your mind babe
Running through your mind...
Bridge
Aye said I wanna be running
through your mind girl,
running through your mind
While you all at work wanna be running
through your mind
Running through your mind girl running
through your mind
But before you leave let me send you off fine
Chorus
Good Morning,
Let me get that breakfast in bed baby
before you leave
I wanna say Good Morning
Just wanna make sure you start
your day properly
(oooooh, ooohh, ooooh...)
Good Morning, baby...
