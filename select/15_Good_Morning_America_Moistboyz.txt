Cracker police doin' cocaine
Found an actress, her sister's insane
Pullin' mojo under the judge
Whitey, nigger, cracker, jap, holdin' a grudge
Push a needle into my eye
Shit stickin' to a jury of flies

Good morning America, are you feeling high
Here's a bloody beautiful girl
Do you wanna watch an old man cry

Cybernetic, crucified
String him up, 'cause the bitch done lied
You sleep at night, slimy squirm
Skullcheese dream, and a soft bed of worms
Custom made for Uncle Sam
Every color in the rainbow scam... I said

Good morning America, are you feeling high
Here's a bloody beautiful girl
Do you wanna watch an old man cry

Whacker, Cracker, Smaker, Slacker, cum cuckin' nigga-jacker,
So specific, motorific, fly high and die by the jive you contrive when you
Pull out alive, the ol' jive you contrive when you pull out alive... you bitch!

Drunk and stupid, Lucicupid
New jack wallet, shiny badge so bright
Sister Satan, Nigga-hatin'
Masturbatin' on her face at hight
Break some legs, so black and brittle
Suckin' cop, cause his dick's so little
Celebrated, Escalated, Hollywood sleaze
