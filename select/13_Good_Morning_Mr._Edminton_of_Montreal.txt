Good morning Mr. Edminton
Mr. Edminton how are you feeling today?
I trust that life is treating you
The way that you want it to
Of course I'm joking with you.
Hello Mr. Lendingworth
Mr. Lendingworth hope you're feeling o.k.
I've brought some books and a finance magazine
Because I feel bad for you.
I'll tell you another thing too.
Remember how they vowed to let that go
If your families paid the ransom
Well I think you both should know
That that's not their intention
But I will help to set you free
If you'll do something for me.
I want an honest job in one of your factories.
Please Mr. Edminton Mr. Edminton tell me that you'll agree
And I'll untie you from that chair presently and get you away from here.
I'm judging by your tears that you
Mr. Lendingworth dear Mr. Lendingworth desire a part in our scheme
Well sir I certainly would never even dream now of excluding you
I'll tell you both what to do.
Tip toe down the spiral stairs
Then just before the cellar door
You'll see a painting of a juggler
Touch his nose and that will open up a secret corridor.
Take the ladder at the end up to the street
And run as fast as you can.
Then in a week or two I'll start my job with you.
You Mr. Edminton Mr. Lendingworth hurry before it's too late for us to escape
