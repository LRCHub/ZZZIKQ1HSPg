(Traditional)

Good morning, Mr. Railroad Man
What time do your trains roll by?
"At 9: 16 and 2: 44 and 25 minutes 'till 5"
"At 9: 16 and 2: 44 and 25 minutes 'till 5"
Thank you, Mr. Railroad Man
I want to watch your trains go by

Standing on a platform, smoking a cheap cigar
And waiting for an old freight train that carries an empty car
Well, I pulled my hat down over my eyes
And I walked across the tracks
And I caught me the end of an old freight train
And I never did come back

Well, I sat down in a gamblin' game
But I could not play my hand
I was thinkin' about the woman I loved
Run away with another man, poor boy
Run away with another man
I was thinking about the woman that I loved
Run away with another man
