Good morning little schoolgirl
Good morning little schoolgirl
Can I go home, can I go home with you?
Tell your mother,honey, and your father, I once was a schoolboy too

Sometime I don't know what
Sometime I don't know what
Woman, what in this world to
Woman, what in this world to do
I don't want to hurt your feelings
Or even get mad with you

I'm going to buy me an airplane
I'm going to buy me an airplane
I'm going to fly all over Chevy, man
I'm going to fly all over Chevy town
If I don't find my baby
I'm not going to let my airplane down

Now who's that coming, yonder?
Now who's that coming, yonder?
She all dressed up and pretty
She all dressed up and pretty to me
If she don't be my baby
I'd soon to see her dead
